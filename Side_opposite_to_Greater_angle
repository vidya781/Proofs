Some inequality relations in Triangles:
1) If two sides of a T are unequal, the larger side has greater angle opposite to it.
2) The sum of any two sides of a T is greater than the third side
3) Of all the line segments that can be drawn to a given line from a point not lying on it, the perpendicular line 
segment is the shortest.

In T(PQR), QS and RS are the bisectors of < Q and < R respectively. Prove that SQ > SQ

Proof:

In T(PQR), PQ > PR
=> < PRQ > < PQR ( angle opposite to greater side of T is greater)
=> 1/2 (< PRQ ) > 1/2 (< PQR)
=> < SRQ > < SQR
( As RS and QS are bisectors of < PRQ and < PQR respectively)
=> SQ > SR ( Side opposite to greater angle is greater)
