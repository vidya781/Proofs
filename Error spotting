The problem that follows below can be approached via different perspectives. 
2 circles externally tangent are also internally tangent to the sides of a right triangle  (6,8,10) with hypoteneuse
being tangent to both the circles. The circles are of the same radii r.Find r.

Proof and approaches:

Let ABC be (6,8,10) with CA = 10 and AB = 6 and BC = 8, AB Perp BC , AC = hypoteneuse

D be the point where one circle touches AB, E be the point where Second circle ( identical) touches base BC
G be the point where circle 2 touches AC and G is closer to the base point C.
H is the point of tangency of circle 1 on Hypoteneuse AC and H is closer to A
I is the centre of Circle 1 and K is the centre of Circle 2

Draw J || to AB and let IJ be one arm of right triangle AB and JK be the base of this smaller triangle. IK is thus || to HG

Give variables now, x = AH = AD
y = CG = CE
So JK = 8-r-y
IJ = 6-r-x and IK = 2r = 10-(x+y) . (all from the geometry)
Since T(IJK) ~ T(ABC)
JK/IK = BC/AC ( property of similar triangles)
=> (8-r-y)/2r = 8/10 , => 15r = 40-5y -----(1)

IJ/IK = AB/AC , => 11r = 30-5x-----(2)

from (1) and (2),
-(x+y) = (26r-70)/5

Further 2r = 10-(x+y)
    => 2r = 10 + [(26r-70)]/5
    => r = 5/4
    
 The following aliter examples are very instructive in spotting flaws and errors and not falling prey to visual Errors 
 in our diagrammatic representations
 
 Assumption 1: Integral values of x, y and r
 
 x + y = 10 - 2r ----(3)
 
 Now BE = 8-y and BM = 6-x ( BE = BM)
 Now BD = 6-x, but BM = 6 - x also ( tangent lengths to a given circle equal from an external point)
 => 8-y = 6-x
 => y-x = 2 ---(4)
 
 from (3) and (4), we get
 y = 6-r ----(5) and x = 4-r ----(6)
 
 since x, y and r > 0 and hold integral values ( an obvious flaw)
 
 from (5) we get r = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 }
 and from (6) we get r = {1,2,3 } and therefore the intersection of these 2 solution sets yield {1,2,3 }
 
 Which value do we select and how do we zero in on a particular value, a unique value of r ?
 
 We note that the area of the 2 circles put together must be smaller than that of the right traingle ABC in which they 
 are inscribed
 
 So Area (T(ABC)) = 1/2 (8) (6) = 24
 
 Area of 2 circles for all 3 radii = 2 ( Pi (r)^2 = 2 pi (1) ^2 = 2 pi = 6.28
                                   = 2(pi (2)^2 = 8 pi > 24 and we discard calculating the third r as it is obviously > 24
                                   So according to our assumption the correct value of r in this case is 1
                                   { and in reality it is off from the correct value by 0.25, being lesser than the correct 
                                     value because our assumption was flawed in the first place. This is an algebraic flaw.}
 
 Now lets move on to a more serious flaw: a geometric flaw:
 
 Assumption 2:Altitude from B to AC passes through the the common point of tangency M
 
 A = 24 as calculated above, one more way of calculating the area = (1/2) 10 . Alt(B)
 => Alt(B) = 24/5
 Alt(B) = BM + r
 => (24/5) = (8-y) + r = 8 - (6-r) + r ( from 5 above)
 => (24/5) = 2 + 2r
 => (24-10)/5 = 2r
 r = 1.4 ( again in this case, off by the correct value by 0.15 , being greater than the correct value of 1.25).
 
 Clearly the assumption of the altitude passing through the common point of tangency does not hold good. A geometric flaw that
 appeals to be be true to the eye but in reality the numbers do not tally at all. It is hoped both these categories of errors would
 prove instructive in spotting our own flawed assumptions and incorrect diagramatic representations in constructing proofs
 and solving problems.
