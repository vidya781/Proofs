In T(ABC), let D be a point on BC such that AD is the internal angle bisector of < A. Choose a point K different from A
on AD such that AC = KC. Prove that AB/AC = BD/CD

Proof:

As usual , it is instructive to clearly draw a figure.

Now AC = KC ( by construction)
Therefore T(ACK) is isosceles
< CAD = < CKD ----(1)
In T(ABD) and T(CKD), < BAD = < CKD
Also < ADB = < CDK ( Vertically opposite angles )
=> < ABD = < KCD ( Third angle of T equal given that two angles are equal)
Therefore T(ABD) S T( CKD) ( Let S denote similarity here)
==> AB/BD = KC/CD
==> (AB)(CD) = (AC)(BD) As KC = AC
