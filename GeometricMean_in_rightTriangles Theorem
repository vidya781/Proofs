Henceforth for the purpose of all future proofs, Triangle will simply be called T.
Thus T (ABC) actually means Triangle ABC.

In T(ABC), let < A be right. Let D be the foot of the altitude from A onto BC.

Prove that AD^2 = BD.CD

Proof:

Going by the inherent structure in the statment we note that it could as well be written as AD/BD = CD/AD

We piece out the triangles embedded within T(ABC) in order to get T(ABD) and T(CAD)
Also < ADB congruent < CDA ( each 90 degrees)
AD is the common side
<ABD congruent <CAD ( it's easy to work this out)
Therefore by AAS test of congruence, T(ABD) similar T(CAD)
Hence CD/AD = AD/BD and this leads to the desired result.

There is also an algebraic way that we can take :

Let AD = d, CB = hypoteneuse = h
Let CD = x
==> DB = h - x
By Pythagoras Theorem, (AD)^2 + (DC)^2 = (AC)^2
==> AD^2 = b^2 - x^2
Now take the RHS of the statement BD.CD = (h-x)x = hx - x^2
AD^2 = b^2 - x^2 where b stands for AC
if AD^2 = BD.CD, then we have b^2 - x^2 = hx - x^2 and hence b^2 = hx

So this means that no matter the triangle ( right angled of course) the product of the hypoteneuse and the length of the
segment where the altitude from the right angle meets the hypotenuse is equal to the square of the arm adjoining the right 
angle.
