PQRS is a Quadrilateral. T and U are points on PS and RS respectively such that PQ = RQ. < PQT = < RQU and <TQS = < UQS
Prove that QT = QU

Proof:

As usual, it is advisable to draw a neat geometric figure.

In T(PQS) and T(RQS), QS = QS ( common side )
< PQS = < RQS ( As < PQS = < PQT + < TQS = < RQU + < UQS = < RQS )
PQ = QR
Therefore T (PQS) congruent T(RQS) ( SAS Rule )
Therefore < QPS = < QRS
That is < QPT = < QRU
In T(PQT) and T(QRU), < PQT = < RQU
=> < QPT = < QRU, PQ = QR
Therefore T(PQT) congruent T(QRU) and hence QT = QU ( By corresponding parts of congruent triangles)
