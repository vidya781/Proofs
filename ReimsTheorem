Let two circles w1 and w2 meet at X and Y. Let a line through X meet w1 and w2 at A and C respectively. Let a line 
through Y meet w1 and w2 at B and D respectively. Prove that AB || CD.

This is the statement of Reim's Theorem

Proof:

We make a simple assumption first that w1 and w2 are not equal circles so we are treating the general case. The specific
case is when w1 and w2 are equal circles so ABCD will become a rectangle in that case with opposite sides being parallel
and the proof being trivial.

As usual, it is instructive to draw a neat geometric figure to tackle this one.
Since A,B,Y and X are concyclic, < XYB + < XAB = 180 ( property of cyclic quadrilaterals)
< XYD + < XYB = 180 ( linear pair property)

==> < XYB + < XAB = < XYD + < XYB 
==> < XAB = < XYD
Also < YBA = < CXY ( by a similar reasoning)

Now Extend AC and BD such that they eventually meet at a point O. ( if w1 < w2 or vice versa, the extension works and they
will meet at a point)

In w1, C,D,X and Y are concyclic. 
< CDY + < CXY = 180 ( property of cyclic quadrilateral)
and < XCD + < DYX = 180 (property of cyclic quadrilateral)

< CDY + < CDO = 180 ( Linear pair property) 
Therefore from the above, < CDO = < CXY = < YBA 
Thus corresponding angles < ODC = < YBA ( congruency )
and by a similar reasoning < OCD = < XAB ( congruency again)
Hence CD || AB
