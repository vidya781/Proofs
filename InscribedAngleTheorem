If A,B, C lie on a circle, then < ACB subtends an arc of measure 2 < ACB.

As usual a diagram is instructive in order to flesh out the proof but for simplicity we will avoid it here.

Join AB. 
Let <ACB = x . We need to prove that <AOB = 2x.
We have that OA = OB = OC = R ( radius of the circle )
Let <OCA = k, Then < OCB = x - k
In Triangle OAC , OC = OA = R. Therefore OAC is an isosceles triangle.
< OAC = k 
By similar arguments <OCB = x - k = < OBC
In Triangle OAB 2 < OAB + O = 180
< AOB = O = 180 - 2 < OAB 
< ACB + <OAC + <OAB + < CBO + <OBA = 180
  x + k + (180-O)/2 + x - k + (180-O)/2 = 180
  Therefore <O = central angle = 2x 
  
  Hence no matter where point C is on the circle , if <ACB is x the angle subtended at the centre of the circle by the 
  points A and B will always be 2x. This is the statement of the Inscribed Angle Theorem.
