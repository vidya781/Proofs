Given T(ABC), construct equilateral triangles T(BCD),T(CAE),T(ABF) outside T(ABC). Prove that AD = BE = CF

Solution:

It is instructive to draw out a clear figure in order to do angle or side chasing with the existing information

Consider T(ECB) and T(ACD)

AC Congruent to EC ( both sides have equal length )
CD Congruent to CB ( as T(CBD) is equilateral)
Then < ACD = < C + 60
< ECB = < C + 60
By SAS test of congruence,
T (ACD) congruent to T (ECB) and therefore AD = EB
Similarly, in T(FBC) and T(ABD) they are congruent by SAS test of congruence and hence
FC = AD
==> FC = AD = EB
