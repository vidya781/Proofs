Let R be a boolean ring with unity.
Show that a) x = -x for some x in R
( R is of characteristic 2)

Proof:

A boolean ring is one in which every element is idempotent. R (+,.) is one such ring.

Since characteristic is 2, and we define let x be in R.

x + k = 0
==> k = -x
Now we have to prove that k and x are one and the same element.
By definition of idempotency, x^2 = x
==> x^2-x = 0
==> x(x-1) = 0 -----(1)
Also
  if we note k as an element in R, then again by idempotency law, k^2 = k
  ==> (-x)^2 = -x
  By additive property, x + (-x)^2 = 0
  ===> x(1 + x) = 0
  The same can be written as:
  -x(-1-x) = 0
  -x(-x-1) = 0-----(2)
  From (1) and (2), it follows that x = -x for V x in R
  
Now in order to prove that a Boolean ring R is commutative:

Proof : We note that for all x in R, -x = (-x)^2 = x^2 = x, so x + x = 0 for all x.
Next x + y = (x + y)^2 = x^2 + xy + yx + y^2, for all x, y in R

Cancellation yields xy + yx = 0
So xy = -(yx)
xy = y(-x)
But -x = x
Therefore xy = yx and hence the ring is commutative by definition.

Proof that 0 is the only nilpotent element

We have to show that in such a boolean ring, 0 is the only nilpotent element or in other words, the trivial nilpotent
element is the only nilpotent element.

Now by definition of nilpotency, x in R is said to be nilpotent, if there is n > 0 such that
x^n = 0 where x^n stands for x.x.x...x ( n times)

We know that in a boolean ring every element is idempotent , that is x^2 = x for all x in R
Let x =/= 0,. x^n = 0 and x^2 = x and ==> x^3 = x^2.x = x^2 = x and similarly, x^n = x for all n >= 1 
and therefopre if x^n = 0 for some n , then x = 0 and is the only nilpotent element

Proof that 1 is the only unit

Let x be a unit and y =/= 0 ( must exist) such that xy = 1 then xy = yx as we know that the Boolean ring is commutative

From above we have that x^2 = x , so it follows that x(1-x) = 0.

Therefore if xy = 1, then multiplying by (1-x), (xy)(1-x) = (1-x)
==> y.x.(1-x) = (1-x)
==> y(0) = 1-x
==> 0 = 1-x 
==> x = 1

Thus 1 is the only unit

Proof that R is an integral domain . <===> R = Z2, the field of 2 elements

We start by assuming that the Boolean Ring R is also an integral domain and find some contradictions in case it's not.
We are given R contains unity.
For x in R, x^2 = x
==> x^2 - x = 0
==> x(x-1) = 0
Giving us the zero divisors x and x-1 in R ( as per definition of a zero divisor, if the above is true, then x must be a 
zero divisor (left zero divisor that is) or we can also have x-1 as the right zero divisor and vice versa) Unless
x = 0 or x = 1.

So if R is to have no non zero divisors, it must contain only 2 elements : 0 and 1
Thus R is isomorphic to Z2.

An example of a commutative ring with 1 of characteristic 2 which is not a Boolean ring

For a Boolean ring, every element must be idempotent , that is if x in R , then x^2 = x

So if the ring R has unit we could define R {1,-1} and test for idempotency here.
We note (1)^2 = 1 so this element is idemopotent.
But (-1) ^2 = 1 and not equal to -1 , so this element is not idempotent
For commutativity to hold good, ab = ba and hence (-1)(1) = 1(-1) 
However characteristic of 2 demands that 2(1) = 0 which is not true
and 2(-1) = 0 which is not true in Z
