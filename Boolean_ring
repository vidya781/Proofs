Let R be a boolean ring with unity.
Show that a) x = -x for some x in R
( R is of characteristic 2)

Proof:

A boolean ring is one in which every element is idempotent. R (+,.) is one such ring.

Since characteristic is 2, and we define let x be in R.

x + k = 0
==> k = -x
Now we have to prove that k and x are one and the same element.
By definition of idempotency, x^2 = x
==> x^2-x = 0
==> x(x-1) = 0 -----(1)
Also
  if we note k as an element in R, then again by idempotency law, k^2 = k
  ==> (-x)^2 = -x
  By additive property, x + (-x)^2 = 0
  ===> x(1 + x) = 0
  The same can be written as:
  -x(-1-x) = 0
  -x(-x-1) = 0-----(2)
  From (1) and (2), it follows that x = -x for V x in R
