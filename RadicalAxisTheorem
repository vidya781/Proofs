Let a line be tangent to circles w1 and w2 at A and B respectively.Show that the radical axis of w1 and w2 bisects segment AB

Proof:

Let w1 be the smaller circle intersecting the larger circle at X and Y.
Let A be on w1 and B be on w2. AB connects w1 and w2 externally and is the common tangent. From Y originates a line through X
and meets AB at point M.

We have to prove that M is the midpoint of AB
=> AM = BM

We note that AM is the tangent and MY is the secant cutting the circle at X from the external point M
Therefore by the tangent secant theorem, (MA)^2 = MY.MX ---(1)

Also MB is the tangent to w2 from external point M. Again it cuts w2 at X and Y where XY is the chord ( MY is the secant here)
(MB)^2 = MY.MX ----(2)
Hence from (1) and (2),

MA^2 = MB^2 
==> MA = MB

Hence M is the mid point of AB and hence the radical axis bisects segment AB
