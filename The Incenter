In T(ABC), let O be the meeting point of bisectors of < A and < B.Show that O is the center of the unique circle inside 
T(ABC) tangent to the sides, the incircle.

Proof:

Let M be the point at which BC is tangent to the circle and let E be the point at which AB is tangent to the circle.

A(T(OBC)) = (1/2)BC(r) = (1/2)a (r) -----(1)
A(T(OAB) = (1/2)AB(r) = (1/2)c (r)-----(2)

Adding (1) and (2),
A(T(OBC)) + A(T(OAB)) = r/2 (a + c) and we have a correlation between s and r

Now we know that A(T(ABC)) = sr where 2s = a + b + c

The difference between A(T(ABC)) and the sum of A(T(OBC)) and A(T(OAB)) is nothing but

d = rs - r/2.(a + c) = rb/2 

Intuitively we see that the remaining area must be that of the third inner Triangle T constituting the space of the 'inner part'
of T(ABC)

Now consider T(OAC) = 1/2 (AC) h3 where h3 is the height of this inner triangle
But remaining area is 1/2 r b 

Therefore by our supposition, we have 1/2 AC h3 = 1/2 r b 
=> h3 = r ( as AC = b)
Therefore its clear that this r is the same r that is the height of the remaining two inner triangles.
Hence the angle bisector of C must meet the other 2 angle bisectors at a point and so OC is the third angle bisector and the 
3 bisectors meet at a common point called the incenter and the circle passing through with the sides as tangents is also
unique called the incircle.
