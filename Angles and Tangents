Line L intersects w at point A.Let B and C be on w and P be on L such that P and B lie on opposite sides of AC.
Then L is tangent to w if and only if < ABC = < CAP

Proof :

We are generally accustomed to a way of thought that leads us to believe that a tangential point is a single point and 
intersection points are at least 2. So in order to solve this problem and build this proof, we let 2 be the points of 
intersection and prove that tangency is possible only if the condition stated in the problem holds.

Orientation: AM be 2 points on L such that these are the points of intersection . B and C are on this circle such that 
A-B-C be on the circle in a clockwise direction. Let P be an external point not on the circle not on T(ABC) such that A-M-P

Clearly BCAM is cyclic. Hence < ABC + < CMA = 180 (property of cyclic quadrilaterals)
Let < ABC = b
Hence b + < CMA = 180 and < CMA = 180 - b ---(1)
Join OA and OC ( O is the centre of w), then < AOC = 2b (Inscribed angle theorem)
OA = OC = r
< OAC = < OCA = k (As T(OAC) is isosceles)
=> 2k + 2b = 180, k = 90 - b ----(2)
Now < BCM + < BAM = 180 ( Property of cyclic quadrilateral)
Now < CMP = 180 - < CMA = 180 - (180 - b) = b (Linear pair property)
Let < CAP = u , < ACM = 180 - ( b + u ) 
But OCMA is a quadrilateral , => 2b + k + u + < OCM + 180 - b = 360 (sum of all angles of a quadrilateral)
=>   b + k + u + < OCM = 180 ----(3)
Also b + k + k + b = 180 ------(4)  (sum of angles of T(OAC))
from (3) and (4), k + b = u + < OCM
                        = u + k + <ACM
                      b = u + < ACM
     Thus b will be equal to u only when < ACM = 0, that is M ceases to exist in geometric cartesian space in that the 
     point of intersection will transform to the point of tangency with AP becoming a tangent.
     In this case < ABC = < CAP and that completes the proof.
     
Another classic case of the algebra leading us to build on the geometric intuition.
