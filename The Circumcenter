Given a T(ABC), prove that the perpendicular bisectors of BC, CA and AB concur at a point O. Morever, show that O is the center 
of the unique circle passing through points A, B and C called the circumcenter.

Proof:

We take a step by step approach to constructing this proof in that let O'P meet BC from O' and let O'Q meet AC from O'.
All we need to show is that the perpendicular bisector of AB will eventually pass through O'. We employ the technique of
transitivity in order to achieve the end aim.

We know that by definition, O'B = O'C ( As in T(O'PB) and T(O'PC), BP = PL, O'P = O'P and < O'PC = < O'PB)
Also in T(O'QC) and T(OQ'A) , O'Q = O'Q and < O'QC = < O'QA = 90 and AQ = QC and O'C = O'A

We need to show O'B = O'A and we are done

We have that O'B = O'C ( by above definition) and O'C = O'A and therefore by transitivity, O'B = O'A
Hence there is a commom point which is O' and O'A = O'B = O'C and hence we conclude that in the presence of the common point 
O' , O'A, O'B and O'C are concurrent. In other words, they meet at a common point.This point is the circumcenter.
