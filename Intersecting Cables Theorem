Consider a segment XY. Choose points A and B on the same side of line XY such that AX perpendicular XY and BY perpendicular
XY. Let XY and BX meet at C. Let Z be the foot of the altiutude from C onto XY.

Prove that 1/CZ = 1/AX + 1/BY

Proof:

CZ || AX

Consider T(XAY), CZ/AX = ZY/XY = (XY-ZX)/XY = 1 - ZX/XY . ...(1)

In T(ABY), CZ || BY, XZ/XY = CZ/BY ....(2)

Adding (1) and (2)

CZ/AX + CZ/BY = 1

Hence 1/CZ = 1/AX + 1/BY
