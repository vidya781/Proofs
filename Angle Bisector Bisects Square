A seemingly innocuous looking problem but has a lot to it. In T(ABC), let < A be right. Construct square BCDE on the 
outside of T(ABC). Show that angle bisector of < A bisects the area of square BCDE.

Proof:

Let l(AB) = c, l(AC) = b and let BC = a . Let the centre of CDEB be O and this means that OC = OB = OE = OD

Our goal is to prove that O lies on the circumcircle of T(ABC) and then relate < OAC and < OBC with measures of arcs.

O be (xo,yo) and as OB^2 = OC^2 , => (xo-c)^2 + yo^2 = xo^2 + (yo-b)^2
We also note that tan 45 = yo/xo and hence xo = yo ( as tan 45 = 1)

byo - xoc = (b^2-c^2)/2 and hence xo(b-c) = (b^2-c^2)/2 and b not equal to c , xo = (b+c)/2 and yo = (b+c)/2
=> O = ( (b+c)/2, (b+c)/2)

Now BC ads diameter dubtends a right angle < CAB = 90 and hence we conclude a circle is passing through C,A and B and we need
to find the equation of the circle having access to 3 points passing through it.

Centre lies on BC

Let (x - xc)^2 + (y - yc)^2 = R^2 and as (0,0) lies on the circle, we get xc^2 + yc^2 = R^2 ----(1)
Also (0-xc)^2 + (b - yc)^2 = R ^ 2 = xc^2 + yc^2 ( from 1)
(b-yc)^2 = yc^2, => yc = b/2

Also (c-xc)^2 + (0-yc)^2 = R^2
(c-xc)^2 = xc^2
=> xc = c/2
Therefore centre of the circle is M (c/2, b/2) and radius of the circle is sqrt((c/2-0)^2 + (b/2-0)^2) = (1/2)sqrt ( b^2 + c^2)

Equation of the circle :
(x - c/2)^2 + (y - b/2)^2 = (b^2 + c^2)/4

To see if O lies on the circle, we subsitute its coordinates in LHS and see what we get:

( (b + c)/2 - c/2)^2 + ( (b + c) / 2 - b/2 )^2 = (b ^ 2 + c ^ 2)/4 = RHS and so O does lie on the circle. Hence COB is a 
semicircle whose radius is 1/2 . sqrt(b^2 + c^2)

Now area of T formed by OCM = (1/2) | xo yo 1| where M is the centre of the circle
                                    | xc yc 1|
                                    | xm ym 1|
                            = (1/2) | b+c/2 b+c/2 1|
                                    |  0 .   b .  1|  = (b^2 + c^2)/8 
                                    |  c/2   b/2  1|
                                    
     Area of T formed by OMB = (1/2) | xo yo  1|
                                     | xb yb  1|
                                     | xm ym  1| = (1/2) | b+c/2  b+c/2 1|  = (b^2 + c^2)/8
                                                         | b/2     b/2  1|
                                                         | c/2     b/2  1| 
    Since the areas of the 2 triangles are equal, the line OM must be bisecting the areas. But how are we to conclude 
    it bisects the entire area, one way to look at it is that DCBE is a square and DE = BC.
    
    We could further use reflective geometry such that a mirror passes along O || to BC in which case, we would have
    a similar semicircle passing through D, E and O and DE serving as the diameter. If M' be the midpoint of DE, then
    by similar arguments, A(T(OM'D)) and A(T(OM'E)) would also be equal. Thus, the entire area would be bisected by MA
    extended, passing through O and M'. Hence the assertion.

PS: When we talk of measures of arcs, we simply note that arc OC is subtended by CAO (= 45 degree) and joining OB, we note 
OC is formed by < OBC and since it is the same arc, < OBC = 45 as well and similarly, arc OB is formed by OCB and OAB each
of which is 45 degree , thus leading us to conclude that OCAB is a square.Thus OC = OB = OD = OE we can further infer that
the entire area is bisected by AO.
