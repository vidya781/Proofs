In T(PQR), extend PQ and let S be a point on this side. Similarly on PR extended, let T be a point on it. < SQR < <TRQ.
Prove that PR < PQ

Proof:

< PQR + < SQR = 180 and < PRQ + < TRQ = 180 ( linear pair )
Therefore < PQR + < SQR = < PRQ + < TRQ 
But < SQR < < TRQ and hence < PQR < < PRQ
Therefore PR < PQ ( Side opposite to greater angle is greater)


We further some interesting properties of isosceles triangles
1) If 2 angles of a T are equal, then the sides opposite to them are also equal
2) If the altitude from one vertex of a T bisects the opposite side, then the T is isosceles.
3) In an isosceles T, altitude from vertex bisects the base
4) If the bisector of vertical angles of a T bisects the base of a T, then the T is isosceles.

T(ABC) is an isosceles T with AB = AC, BD and CE are the 2 medians of T. Prove that BD = CE

In T(ABD),T(AEC), AB = AC ( Given)
AD = AE ( As D is the midpoint of AC, AD = DC ie AD = 1/2 (AC))
< BAC = < CAB
(As E is the mid point of AB, so AE = EB )
AE = 1/2 (AB)
As AB = AC, AD = AE and T(ABD) congruent T(AEC) ( SAS Rule ) and hence BD = CE
